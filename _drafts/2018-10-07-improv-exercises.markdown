Improv Exercise #1: Count to 3 (30-second exercise)
Everyone gets into pairs. In the pair, you have to count to 3 repeatedly, alternating between the two of you, so I say 1, you say 2, I say 3, you say 1 and so forth. People get this wrong and laugh a little bit.

After 20 seconds or so stop them and tell them instead of saying “2” they must clap, again alternating. (So, I say “1”, you clap, I say “3”. Then you say “1”, I clap.) Sounds simple, but it's devilishly hard! Again only 20-30 seconds of this everyone will be laughing, feeling silly and re-energised for the work ahead.

Improv Exercise #2: What I’m Grateful For (1-minute exercise)
Get everyone in a circle. When their name is called by the facilitator, they have to without hesitation say "I'm grateful for..." and then list the first six ridiculous things that come to their head. (Explain upfront these shouldn't be sensible things, but as ridiculous as possible e.g. I'm grateful for heavily loaded lorries, ready salted crisps, trees that don't lose their leaves...) You don't explain why, just list them as quickly as possible with as few ers/uhhs between each as possible.

This gets people thinking creatively so they'll bring more out of the box ideas to your session, and for better or worse gives you an insight into the crazy things that pop into our teammates' heads.
