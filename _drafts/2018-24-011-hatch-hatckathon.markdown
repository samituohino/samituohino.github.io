Despite Hatch being hosted in the secure facility of Ministry of Justice at St James Park for the second year, here's a full rundown of what happened. FIXME write about Hatch Diversity.

Who would have known 100 people would be silently working on problems related to the United Nations sustainability goals downstairs.

This was the first hackathon I've been in (and obviously helped to facilitate) and I always had this idea that it would be a group of people turning up, self organising the getting on with coding. Not quite. A lot of work goes into organising them to make sure the team have everything they need, are fed, hydrated, working on the goals they've chosen to work on and most importantly building something that would be useful. There's nothing more useless than building something good that is useless.

Yes there were prices too. 

## Day 1 - Saturday ##

I was meant to float around, and did for a bit, but got quite attached to a group trying to figure out what to do with their goal: UN16. There were 10 problems the hackathon team could have tackled and I was helping them to figure out what problem they'd go after. I jumped in to help narrow down the problem after the conversation (read: debate) had been going on for a while already. Good old dot voting revealed the top candidate: abuse, kidnap.  

Wristbands were mentioned, microchip implants, GPS and various location based solutions were thrown around. These were discarded as non-viable to test in one and half days (quite rightly so).

The team went through a couple of iterations of trying to figure out what to build. Moving vans in Africa to register births was a strong candidate for a bit but again discarded along the way.

The team finally settled on making it easier to report crime to tackle abuse. Catcalling, harassment is a daily issue in the western world, let alone developing countries and the team got onto building a prototype. I had to reel them in quite a bit on the proposed MVP - an app that would a user report a crime quickly with just text (rather than picture, video, audio, location etc) was deemed to be the first iterations.

I was super proud when one of the team member later on, after I had stepped out asking how they can quickly test if it could solve the problem, came over with a laptop with a simple surveymonkey survey. They had taken the approach to asking around from the hundred off people on site if their proposal would lower the barrier to report a crime, as their initial idea validation.
