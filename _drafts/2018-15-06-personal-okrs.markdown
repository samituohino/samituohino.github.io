Following from my previous post on How to Use OKRs in your team, I thought I'd open up what I've done to experiment with OKRs in my personal life.

#### Personal Objectives ####

I've got a Google Doc with my Personal OKRs for 2018 <add link here> that, in the light of OKRs being public, that I've opened for everyone to look at.

I've captured them here too for easier reading and for reference in case stuff changes in the Doc.

O: Get more exposure for my music
KR: Release 7 new songs in streaming services
KR: Shoot, edit and release 3 music videos
KR: Increase number of Online Streams by 100%

Why this Objective?
I'd like to learn more and think the quickest way to learn is to get a lot of feedback. Also, interestingly, this gives me a good reason to expand my skills to video alongside my humble music recording hobby.

Why these Key Results?
I think they'll help me get more feedback. Tackling the problem from several sides (release to streaming services, using video channels and using analytics to prove things are going the right way) should give me an indication what's working and what's not whilst nudging me towards the Objective.

Why do I think these are uncomfortable?
For a number of reasons. Doubling the number of people who listen to music I've made is scary in itself. I'm pretty bad at marketing and have limited time to work on them. I haven't really shot, edited and uploaded videos aside some simple stuff.

O: Travel more in European countries
KR: Visit 4 new countries in Europe
