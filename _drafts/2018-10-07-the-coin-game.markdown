## The coin game ##

Divide into two teams, seated opposite each other. The task is to pass items (coins/notes/poker chips) to the person next to you one by one with varying rules each round.

Time the rounds. Give the teams 30 seconds to a minute each round.

General rules:

* The coins need to be flipped when passed to the next person
* The coins need to touch the table before the next person can pick it up
* Only 1 coins can be passed at a time
* Only the coins that make it to the last person in the team matter - coins mid-flight do not count

Optional: Use the non-dominant hands when passing the coins
Optional: Use both notes and coins. Fold the notes into squares, and pass it to the next person (no throwing!) so that the note stays folded
Optional: Use currencies from different countries so that the coins are not familiar to everyone

#### Round 1 - Batch size 5 ####

* You need to wait until the next person has 5 coins before passing them one by one to the next person
* Only the number of coins matter
* Value of the coins does not matter
* All the coins are hidden under a paper, not organised

#### Round 2 - No Batch size limit ####

* No limit on the number of coins
* Only the number of coins matter (like on the previous round)
* Value of the coins does not matter
* All the coins are hidden under a paper, not organised

Facilitator note: This should be faster than Round 1 as more coins should make it to the end.

#### Round 3 - Value matters ####

* This time the summed up value of coins matter
* Coins are hidden under a paper, unorganised

#### Round 4 - Prioritised value ####

* Value of the coins matter similar to Round 3
* Coins can be organised and are not hidden

Facilitator note: This should lead to more value as the teams can move the most valuable coins first
