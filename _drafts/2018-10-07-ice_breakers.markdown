#### What the hell is an Ice Breaker? ####

Ice breakers are small games and activities to get people in the right mood, to get them know each other a bit better, to set the mood for the day.


#### The Four Facts Game ####

Each person writes down four facts about themselves, one of which is a lie. Each person takes turns reading their list aloud and the rest of the team writes down the one they think is the lie. When all are done reading the lists aloud, the first person reads their list again and identifies the lie. The team sees how well they did.

#### Birthday Game ####

Everyone stands up in a straight line. After they are in line, tell them to re-arrange the line so that they are ordered by their birthday. January 1 on one end and December 31 at the other end. This must all be done without talking or writing anything down.

#### 4 Questions #### 

The following 4 questions are asked to the group. They are given some time to think about and write down their answers which are then shared with the group.
- If you weren’t a Software Engineer/Agile Coach/TPO, what would you be and why?
- Which historical figure would you like to meet and why?
- If you were to change your name, what name would you adopt going forward? Why?
- What is  your favourite material object that you already own?

#### The Coin Game ####

Get £20 worth of different coins. The idea is to split the group in two and make it obvious smaller batch size equals to value faster. 

Especially useful for when you're setting about to define or improve your process.
