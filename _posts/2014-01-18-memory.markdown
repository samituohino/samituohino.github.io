## My memory bank of useful commands and file locations. Maybe you find it useful too.

## Version control

#### SVN recursive revert

svn revert . --recursive 

When? You've done experimental changes and want to make sure you are not going to commit them by accident. 

## File locations

#### Windows host file resides inÂ 

%systemroot%\system32\drivers\etc\ 

When? You want to point your PC to somewhere else than the default.
